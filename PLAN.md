# PLAN.md — Sovereign, a local-first AI workspace

Plan of record for `BRIEF.md`. **No application code has been written.** This document is the thing
you approve; section 5 (dependencies) doubles as the approved-dependency list that rule 0.4 binds me
to for the rest of the project.

Read in this order if you're short on time: §1 (what your hardware forces), §7 (milestones), §5
(deps). Everything else is reference.

---

## 0. Where the code lives, and one thing you should know up front

This repository is `tico-market` — a SwiftUI/Firebase iOS marketplace app. It is not the empty
folder the brief assumes. Nothing in the Swift project is touched; the workspace gets its own
subtree:

```
tico-market/
├── BRIEF.md          ← the spec, section 2 filled in from your answers
├── PLAN.md           ← this file
├── Sources/ …        ← existing iOS app, untouched
└── sovereign/        ← everything in this plan lives here
```

**Tradeoff:** keeping `BRIEF.md`/`PLAN.md` at the repo root makes them findable by a fresh session
that starts with `cat BRIEF.md`, at the cost of two files that look unrelated to the iOS app —
inspectability wins. If you'd rather this be its own repository, say so before M1 and I'll move the
subtree; nothing in the plan depends on the location.

---

## 1. What your hardware actually forces

Recorded in `BRIEF.md` §2: **8–12GB NVIDIA VRAM, Windows 11 + WSL2, no container runtime at all.**
Six decisions fall straight out of that, and they are not negotiable-by-preference — they're
arithmetic.

### 1.1 The VRAM budget is the whole design constraint

On a 24GB machine the shader background is free. On yours, the browser's GPU process and the model
are roommates in the same 8–12GB. So the VRAM accounting the brief asks to "surface in the UI"
(§2, §4.10) is not a vanity readout here — it's the thing that decides whether the app works.

The budget the app computes and shows, for a 10GB card running an 8B model at Q4_K_M:

| Consumer | Cost | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Model weights (8B, Q4_K_M) | ~4.7–5.0 GB | from the GGUF file size, not an estimate |
| KV cache @ 32K ctx | ~1.0–2.0 GB | computed from GGUF metadata, see formula below |
| llama.cpp compute buffers | ~0.4–0.8 GB | batch-size dependent |
| Chromium GPU process (on Windows, same card) | ~0.3–0.8 GB | **the one everybody forgets** |
| Background shader + edge glow | ~0.05–0.15 GB | half-res FBO, one draw call |
| Windows desktop compositor | ~0.3–0.6 GB | already spent before you start |

That lands at roughly 7–9.5 GB. On a 12GB card it fits at 32K context with headroom; on an 8GB card
it does not, and the app must say so in words rather than dying inside `ggml_backend_alloc`.

KV cache is computed, not guessed:

```
kv_bytes ≈ 2 × n_layers × n_kv_heads × head_dim × ctx_len × dtype_bytes
```

All four model terms come from the GGUF header. `dtype_bytes` is 2 for f16, 1 for the `q8_0` KV
cache we default to on this hardware (halves the cost, costs almost nothing in quality). This
formula is implemented once, in `server/hardware/recommend.py`, and the same numbers drive both
`make models` and the HUD — no second copy in the frontend.

**Preflight, not postmortem.** Before any generation the server checks
`free_vram ≥ weights + kv(requested_ctx) + compute_buffers + browser_reserve`. If it fails you get a
sentence — "32K context needs 1.8GB of KV cache; 1.1GB free. Drop to 16K, or enable Performance mode
to hand back ~150MB" — and a button that applies the fix. Rule 2.x of the brief ("never crash with
an OOM I have to decode from a stack trace") is enforced here and tested here.

### 1.2 The model shortlist is resolved at runtime, never hardcoded

Your brief warns that the Aug-2026 tags move fast, and I can't verify them from here. So
`make models` does not ship a table of tags — it ships a table of *requirements*
(`sovereign/models.toml`: family, param count, quant, min VRAM, context ceiling, why-you'd-pick-it)
and resolves live tags against the Ollama library / HuggingFace at run time, showing the real
download size returned by the registry. A tag that no longer exists shows as unavailable instead of
downloading something surprising.

For your tier the shortlist it will rank:

- **`qwen3:8b` @ Q4_K_M** — default. General reasoning, ~5GB, 32K native context. This is the pick.
- **`qwen2.5-coder:7b` @ Q4_K_M** — if the workload is mostly code.
- **A 12–14B at Q4** — only on the 12GB card, and only at ≤16K context. `make models` shows it as
  fitting-but-tight and tells you what it costs you in context.
- **`gpt-oss:20b` and everything above it in the brief's shortlist** — listed as *not runnable
  fully-offloaded on this machine*, with the number that proves it, rather than silently omitted.
  Partial CPU offload is offered with an honest tok/s estimate from a 30-second bench, not a
  marketing number.

Expected tokens/sec is **measured, not printed from a table**: `make models` runs a short
prompt-eval + generation bench after download and stores the real number for your card in the DB,
which is also what the HUD's baseline compares against.

### 1.3 WSL2 changes four implementation details

1. **NVML works, but partially.** `pynvml` loads `/usr/lib/wsl/lib/libnvidia-ml.so.1` and reports
   VRAM and utilization; **power draw and temperature are frequently unavailable through the WSL
   passthrough**. The HUD (§4.10) shows `—` with a tooltip explaining why, and never invents a
   number. This is a real, visible degradation of a P1 feature and I'd rather you hear it now.
2. **`watchdog` inotify does not fire on `/mnt/c`.** Windows-drive paths need `PollingObserver`
   (higher latency, more CPU). The indexer picks the observer per-path automatically and the RAG
   settings page labels Windows paths as "polled every N seconds" so the behavior isn't mysterious.
   Recommendation surfaced in the UI: keep indexed folders on the WSL ext4 side.
3. **Two hosts, one localhost.** The backend binds `127.0.0.1` *inside WSL2*; Windows' localhost
   forwarding makes `http://localhost:8080` reachable from the Windows browser. That is still a
   loopback-only bind — nothing is exposed to the LAN — and the bind guard in §8 treats a
   non-loopback bind exactly as the brief demands.
4. **WSL2 RAM ceiling.** WSL2 defaults to ~50% of host RAM, which caps CPU-offload and the
   embedding/rerank models. The hardware page reads the actual cgroup limit and shows it next to a
   one-line `.wslconfig` snippet if it's the binding constraint.

### 1.4 No Docker ⇒ two things move

- **SearXNG (M4)** runs native: its own `uv` venv under `sovereign/services/searxng/`, launched by
  `make dev` as a child process bound to `127.0.0.1`. Note it is AGPL-3.0 — it stays a **separate
  process we never link into**, which keeps the brief's "permissively licensed" preference intact
  for anything we actually import.
- **vLLM / SGLang (§3)** is planned as an adapter only, and honestly deprioritized to M5+: vLLM
  needs more VRAM headroom than this machine has, and without Docker it's a heavy native install.
  The adapter is ~80 lines against the OpenAI-compatible base, so it costs nothing to keep and it's
  there the day you add a bigger card. The **OpenAI-compatible adapter is built in M1** regardless —
  that's your "borrow a frontier model" path and it needs no local VRAM.

### 1.5 Embeddings and voice get downgraded, on purpose

`bge-m3` (568M, ~2.2GB f16) plus a reranker plus an 8B model does not fit next to the browser on
this card. M4 defaults instead to **`nomic-embed-text` (137M) on GPU** or bge-small, and runs
**`bge-reranker-v2-m3` on CPU** where its latency is acceptable for top-20 reranking. Same for M5:
`faster-whisper` at `small`/`int8_float16` (~0.5–1GB), Piper TTS on CPU. Every one of these is a
settings-page choice with its VRAM cost printed next to it — you can spend the memory differently
if you want, you just can't spend it twice.

---

## 2. Design tradeoffs, one sentence each (brief rule 0.10)

Each of these picks the inspectable option over the clever one.

1. **Context blocks are snapshotted in full, per assistant message** — the DB grows faster, but
   "what exactly was in context for this answer" stays answerable a year later instead of being
   re-derived from code that has since changed.
2. **Logprobs live in a side table, capped at top-5** — roughly 5–10× the storage of the message
   text, so there's a "purge logprobs older than N days" action; keeping them is what makes §4.3
   work on old messages.
3. **SSE with a DB-backed token log, not WebSockets** — one extra write per token batch, in exchange
   for resume-after-refresh, `curl`-able streams, and a transcript that survives a crash mid-answer.
4. **Token counts come from the inference server's own tokenizer** (`/tokenize` on llama.cpp), not a
   local estimator — one round-trip per assembly, but the Context Inspector's numbers are the real
   ones rather than a plausible-looking lie.
5. **Nudge resume uses raw completion with the partial as prefix** — requires a provider that
   exposes `/completion`; chat-only backends fall back to re-sending the partial as an assistant
   turn and the UI says "KV cache not reused on this backend" instead of pretending.
6. **`sqlite-vec` brute-force scan, no ANN index** — linear in chunk count (fine to ~100k chunks on
   this machine), and there is no index structure that can silently corrupt or go stale.
7. **The shader ships on by default, with an automatic, announced fallback** — on a card this size
   the app measures the VRAM cost at startup and drops to the CSS mesh gradient if the model needs
   the memory, telling you it did so; the alternative (silently degrading) is exactly the behavior
   the brief hates.
8. **Every generation is a row before it is a stream** — the assistant message row and its `run` row
   are written *before* the first token, so an interrupted generation is a real, inspectable,
   resumable object rather than lost client state.

---

## 3. File and folder tree

`(M1)`…`(M6)` marks the milestone that creates the file. Nothing is created before its milestone —
no empty stubs, per rule 0.3. Every file listed is projected under ~250 lines; the ones at risk are
called out.

## 4. Database schema

One SQLite file, WAL mode, `foreign_keys=ON`, `synchronous=NORMAL`. Forward-only numbered
migrations, no ORM — the schema is readable in a text editor and greppable, which is the point.

  text        TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at  INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

### 4.4 Later migrations (sketch — finalized at their milestone)

- **004 knowledge (M4):** `sources(path, kind, observer)`, `chunks(source_id, offset, text, hash)`,
  `vec_chunks` (`sqlite-vec` vec0 virtual table), `fts_chunks` (FTS5 external-content over
  `chunks`), `memory_entries(path, scope, project_id, hash)`,
  `memory_usage(entry_id, message_id, used_at)` — that last table is what makes "retrieved 14 times,
  last used 3 days ago" real rather than approximate.
- **005 council (M5):** `council_runs`, `council_answers(run_id, model_id, label, content)` with the
  A/B/C label stored separately from `model_id` so the judge query can be built blind by
  construction, and `model_scores(model_id, category, wins, n)`.
- **006 agents (M6):** `jobs(cron, prompt, project_id, enabled)`, `job_runs`,
  `tool_grants(project_id, tool, granted_at)`, `audit_log(tool, args_hash, path, result_hash, ...)`
  — hashes and paths only, never contents (brief §7).

### 4.5 DAG invariants, enforced and tested

1. `parent_id` is NULL or refers to a row in the same conversation created earlier ⇒ acyclic by
   construction; no cycle check needed at read time.
2. An edit never mutates: it inserts a sibling with the same `parent_id` and `edited_from_id` set.
   **Nothing is ever destroyed** (§4.1).
3. `active_leaf_id` must be a leaf-or-any node in the same conversation; the active path is
   `ancestors(active_leaf)` reversed.
4. Sibling order is `created_at, id` — stable, so `‹ 2/4 ›` doesn't shuffle between renders.
5. A `merge` (§4.1) creates a new node whose `parent_id` is the common ancestor, with the two source
   ids recorded in `forked_reason` provenance — the tree stays a tree; merges are recorded, not
   structural.

---

## 5. API surface

All request/response bodies are Pydantic models from `server/models/` — that is the only definition
of these shapes anywhere in the system. `make types` regenerates `web/src/api/schema.gen.ts` from
`/openapi.json`; `make check` regenerates and **fails if the file changed**, so a backend model
edit that isn't reflected in the frontend types breaks the build rather than production.

### 5.1 M1 — spine

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/health` | version, db ok, providers up |
| `GET` | `/api/hardware` | GPU, VRAM free/total, RAM cgroup limit, disk, NVML field availability |
| `GET` | `/api/hardware/budget?model_id&ctx_len` | the §1.1 table, computed — powers preflight + UI |
| `GET` | `/api/providers` | discovered providers + `Capabilities{logprobs, prefix, embeddings}` |
| `GET` | `/api/models` | known models incl. bench numbers |
| `POST` | `/api/models/pull` | SSE download progress (used by `make models` and the UI) |
| `GET`/`POST` | `/api/conversations` | list / create |
| `GET` | `/api/conversations/{id}` | full tree + active path |
| `PATCH` | `/api/conversations/{id}` | title, `active_leaf_id`, system prompt, preset |
| `DELETE` | `/api/conversations/{id}` | hard delete, cascades |
| `POST` | `/api/conversations/{id}/messages` | append a message under a parent |
| `POST` | `/api/chat/stream` | **the main event** — see 5.4 |
| `POST` | `/api/chat/runs/{run_id}/stop` | Esc: stop and keep the partial |
| `GET` | `/api/chat/runs/{run_id}/events` | reconnect/resume a live or finished run |

### 5.2 M2 — graph and context

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `PATCH` | `/api/messages/{id}` | edit **any role incl. assistant** → returns the new sibling |
| `GET` | `/api/messages/{id}/siblings` | for `‹ 2/4 ›` |
| `POST` | `/api/messages/merge` | span-merge two siblings → new leaf |
| `POST` | `/api/context/preview` | assemble **without generating** → `ContextAssembly` |
| `PATCH` | `/api/context/blocks` | toggle / pin / reorder before sending |
| `GET` | `/api/messages/{id}/context` | what actually went in, after the fact |

### 5.3 M3+ — instrument panel and beyond

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/messages/{id}/tokens` | logprobs + top-5 alternatives for the x-ray layer |
| `POST` | `/api/chat/force_token` | `{message_id, token_idx, token}` → truncate, force, resume |
| `POST` | `/api/chat/runs/{run_id}/nudge` | abort, keep partial, resume as prefix continuation |
| `POST` | `/api/chat/rerun` | `{message_id, params?}` → sibling branch (+ diff on the client) |
| `GET` | `/api/hud/stream` | SSE, 1Hz telemetry samples |
| `GET` | `/api/hud/counters` | lifetime tokens + cost-avoided |
| M4 | `/api/knowledge/*`, `/api/memory/*`, `/api/search` | index control, memory CRUD, private web search |
| M5 | `/api/council/*`, `/api/voice/*` | fan-out + blind judge; STT/TTS streams |
| M6 | `/api/agents/*`, `/api/tools/approvals`, `/api/audit` | jobs, approval gate, audit log |

### 5.4 The streaming contract

`POST /api/chat/stream` returns `text/event-stream`. Events are a discriminated union
(`server/models/stream.py`), so the TypeScript side gets an exhaustive `switch`:

```
event: assembly     data: ContextAssembly       ← first, always: blocks + token counts + evictions
event: run          data: {run_id, message_id, seed, model_id}
event: token        data: {i, text, logprob?, top?, t_ms}   ← id: <run_id>:<i>
event: nudge        data: {token_idx, text}                 ← a nudge landed here
event: usage        data: {prompt_tokens, gen_tokens, prompt_eval_ms, gen_ms, tps}
event: done         data: {stop_reason}
event: error        data: {code, message, remedy?}          ← e.g. VRAM preflight with a fix button
```

Three properties this buys, all of which are tested (`tests/test_stream_interrupt.py`):

- **Resumable.** Each `token` event carries `id: <run_id>:<i>`. A reconnect with `Last-Event-ID`
  replays from `i+1` out of `message_tokens`, so a browser refresh mid-answer loses nothing.
- **Interruptible without loss.** `stop` and `nudge` both close the upstream request, flush the
  partial into `messages.content`, and mark the run — the partial is a first-class row, not
  client state (tradeoff #8).
- **`curl`-able.** `curl -N localhost:8080/api/chat/stream -d @body.json` is a supported debugging
  path, which is most of why the brief chose SSE.

**Prompt-injection boundary (brief §7):** every block of kind `rag`, `tool`, or `web` is wrapped by
the assembler in an explicit data envelope with its provenance, and the tool layer (M6) will only
ever dispatch tools from calls parsed out of the *model's* output channel — never from text that
arrived inside a retrieved document. That's an architectural boundary in `context/blocks.py` and
`tools/gate.py`, not a sentence in a system prompt.

## 6. Dependencies — the approved list

One line of justification each, as required. **This list is what rule 0.4 binds me to**: after you
approve it, I ask before adding anything not here. Everything is permissively licensed (MIT / BSD /
Apache-2.0) except the two separate-process services noted at the end.

### 6.1 Backend, installed at M1

| Package | Why |
|---|---|
| `fastapi` | The brief picked it; also gives us the OpenAPI schema that generates the TS types for free. |
| `uvicorn[standard]` | ASGI server; `--host 127.0.0.1` by default and no phone-home. |
| `pydantic` (v2) | Single source of truth for every shape in the system (rule 0.5). |
| `pydantic-settings` | Typed config from `config.toml` + env, and the place the bind/auth invariant lives. |
| `sse-starlette` | Correct SSE framing plus client-disconnect propagation, which is what makes cancel work. |
| `httpx` | One async HTTP client for every provider adapter, with streaming response support. |
| `sqlite-vec` | Vector search inside the same SQLite file — the brief's "no separate vector service". |
| `nvidia-ml-py` | The maintained `pynvml` package; reads VRAM/util through the WSL2 NVML shim (§1.3). |
| `huggingface-hub` | Resolves and downloads GGUF files with resume + hash verification for `make models`. |
| `psutil` | System RAM / CPU for the HUD, and the WSL cgroup memory ceiling. |
| `uv` (tool) | Fast, lockfile-based env management; no daemon, no telemetry. |

### 6.2 Backend, added at their milestone

| Package | Milestone | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `watchdog` | M4 | Filesystem events, with the `PollingObserver` fallback `/mnt/c` requires. |
| `pymupdf` | M4 | Fast, dependency-light text+offset extraction so RAG citations can point at a real offset. |
| `markdown-it-py` | M4 | Structure-aware Markdown chunking for `./memory/` and notes. |
| `GitPython` | M4 | Auto-commit the memory repo so "diff history" in §4.7 is real git history. |
| `numpy` | M4 | Cosine similarity, RRF fusion, and the agreement matrix — nothing heavier needed. |
| `faster-whisper` | M5 | Streaming local STT that runs at `small`/int8 inside our VRAM budget. |
| `piper-tts` | M5 | CPU-only streaming TTS; leaves the GPU for tokens. |
| `apscheduler` | M6 | Cron-syntax jobs persisted into the same SQLite file, per the brief. |

### 6.3 Dev / test

| Package | Why |
|---|---|
| `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio` | The three test subjects in rule 0.7 are all async-adjacent backend logic. |
| `ruff` | Lint + format in one fast tool, so `make check` stays quick. |
| `mypy` | The Pydantic-as-truth rule is only real if the server side is actually checked. |

### 6.4 Frontend

| Package | Why |
|---|---|
| `react`, `react-dom`, `typescript`, `vite` | The stack the brief specified. |
| `tailwindcss` | Utility CSS; no component library, since §5 is bespoke. |
| `framer-motion` | Spring physics — the only motion primitive §5.4 allows. |
| `three`, `@react-three/fiber` | The GLSL background plane and its half-res render target. |
| `zustand` | Small, un-opinionated store; slices map cleanly onto §5's state machine. |
| `d3-hierarchy` | Tree layout math for the minimap; we render the SVG ourselves. |
| `diff` | Word-level diff for "rerun with…" sibling comparison (§4.5). |
| `openapi-typescript` (dev) | Generates `schema.gen.ts` from OpenAPI — the other half of rule 0.5. |

**Deliberately not included:** no component library, no `axios` (fetch is enough), no charting
library (the HUD and the agreement heatmap are small bespoke SVG), **no frontend test runner** —
rule 0.7 names three test subjects and all three live in the backend, so adding Vitest would be
adding a dependency to test things the brief told me not to test.

**Separate processes, not imports:** `llama.cpp` (MIT, built from source in WSL2 with
`-DGGML_CUDA=ON`) and `SearXNG` (AGPL-3.0, M4, its own venv). Neither is linked into our code, so the
AGPL stays contained to the service; both bind loopback only.

**Telemetry audit (rule 0.11):** at M1 I verify and pin the no-phone-home posture —
`HF_HUB_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1`, `DO_NOT_TRACK=1`, Vite with no remote fonts or CDN assets, SearXNG
configured with no external metrics. `make check` greps the built frontend bundle for absolute
external URLs and fails if any appear.

---

## 7. Milestones

Every milestone ends with an app you can open at `http://localhost:5173` and actually use (rule
0.2). "Done when" is written as something you can perform, not something I can claim. Each bullet
inside a milestone is a green checkpoint and a commit (rule 0.8).

### M1 — Spine
FastAPI + SSE, llama.cpp provider (+ OpenAI-compatible, Ollama, LM Studio autodetect), migration
001, hardware probe and the VRAM budget math, `make models` end to end, React shell, the shader
background with the idle → thinking → streaming state machine, the edge glow, per-word streaming
text, Performance mode, and the interrupt half of `test_stream_interrupt.py` (stop-and-keep +
reconnect resume).

- **Done when:** you run `make models`, it reads your real VRAM, ranks a shortlist that fits,
  downloads `qwen3:8b`, benches it, and you hold a full conversation while the background sits at
  idle 0.12, springs to thinking, pulses per token during streaming, and Esc stops a generation
  leaving the partial text in place. Refreshing mid-answer reattaches to the live stream.
- **Also done when:** on a deliberately over-committed context you get the preflight sentence with a
  fix button, not an OOM trace.

### M2 — The graph
Migrations 002, DAG module + `test_dag.py`, edit-any-message-including-the-assistant's, sibling
navigation, the minimap, the `ContextAssembler` with real `/tokenize` counts, block toggle / pin /
reorder, loud eviction notices, and `test_context_accounting.py`.

- **Done when:** you fork one conversation three ways — including by editing what the assistant
  said and continuing from your version — switch between branches from the minimap and the
  `‹ 2/4 ›` arrows, and for each branch open the context bar and see the exact block list with real
  token counts, pin one block, drop another, and watch the numbers change before you send.

### M3 — The instrument panel
Migration 003, logprob capture and storage, the x-ray tint layer, the token popover with top-5
alternatives, forced-token truncate-and-resume, live nudge with prefix continuation + inline
markers, deterministic rerun and rerun-with + word diff, the Sovereign HUD, and the nudge/forced-
token half of `test_stream_interrupt.py`.

- **Done when:** you click a token mid-answer, pick the second-most-likely alternative, and watch
  the answer take a different path from that token — and separately, you nudge a running generation
  and it continues from the partial text rather than restarting. Rerun with the same seed produces
  a byte-identical sibling; that's the assertion.
- **Honest note:** on providers reporting `supports_logprobs=False` the x-ray toggle is absent, not
  greyed-out-and-lying. The HUD shows `—` for power/temp if WSL's NVML doesn't expose them (§1.3).

### M4 — Knowledge
Migration 004, watcher (with the `/mnt/c` polling path), chunking with byte offsets, embeddings via
the provider layer, hybrid FTS5 + `sqlite-vec` retrieval with RRF, CPU reranking, memory as
git-backed Markdown with per-entry retrieval stats, retrieval attribution in every answer, native
SearXNG, multi-step research mode.

- **Done when:** you point it at a folder, watch indexing progress (pausable, and it yields to
  generation), ask a question, and click a citation that opens the source file at the right offset —
  and the Memory page lets you edit a fact, see the git diff, and hard-delete one with "Forget this".

### M5 — Plurality and voice
Migration 005, Council fan-out into parallel columns, blind judging (labels A/B/C, model names
stripped before the judge sees anything), agreement matrix heatmap, per-category scoreboard,
faster-whisper STT, Piper TTS, the orb.

- **Reality check for your hardware:** running 3 models concurrently on 8–12GB is not possible.
  The Council on this machine runs **sequentially by default** with a visible queue, and offers
  true concurrency only for providers that don't consume local VRAM (an OpenAI-compatible endpoint,
  or a second machine). The UI is the same; the honesty is in the queue indicator.

### M6 — Autonomy
Migration 006, APScheduler jobs, the agent loop, inbox, the approval-gated tool registry, the
injection boundary in `tools/gate.py`, hash-and-path-only audit log, Obsidian export.

- **Done when:** a scheduled job runs, asks for approval before its first file write, appears in the
  audit log with hashes and paths only, and drops a result into the inbox — and a document
  containing "ignore your instructions" is surfaced to you as flagged data rather than acted on.

---

## 8. Tests, checks, and the Makefile

### 8.1 Exactly three test subjects (rule 0.7)

| File | What it pins down |
|---|---|
| `tests/test_dag.py` | fork-on-edit creates a sibling and destroys nothing; `path_to_leaf` is the reversed ancestor chain; sibling ordering is stable; deep chains don't recurse to death; merge records provenance and keeps the tree acyclic. |
| `tests/test_context_accounting.py` | assembled token total equals the provider's own count of the final prompt (the bug that otherwise silently truncates); pinned blocks survive eviction and unpinned ones don't; every eviction emits a notice; toggling and reordering change the total in the expected direction. |
| `tests/test_stream_interrupt.py` | stop keeps the partial and marks `stop_reason`; reconnect with `Last-Event-ID` replays exactly the missing tokens with no duplicates or gaps; a nudge aborts, persists the partial, and resumes with the partial as prefix; forced-token truncates at the byte offset and continues; a provider dying mid-stream leaves a `stopped` row, never a half-written one. |

All three run against a **fake provider with a scripted token stream** (`tests/conftest.py`) — no
model, no GPU, so `make check` is fast and runs in CI on this repo's existing runners.

### 8.2 `make check` also enforces the non-code requirements

- `ruff` + `mypy` + `pytest`.
- **Type drift:** regenerate `schema.gen.ts` from OpenAPI; fail if it differs (rule 0.5).
- **File length:** fail on any source file over 250 lines (rule 0.6) — a lint rule, not a habit.
- **Contrast:** `scripts/contrast_check.py` renders the shader's extreme frames headless and asserts
  body text ≥ 4.5:1 against the brightest pixel it can actually produce (§5.5) — testing the
  shader's real extremes, not a screenshot.
- **No phone-home:** grep the built bundle for external absolute URLs (rule 0.11).

### 8.3 Makefile

```
make dev      # migrate → start llama.cpp (if configured) → uvicorn on 127.0.0.1:8080 → vite
make check    # ruff, mypy, pytest, type-drift, file-length, contrast, no-phone-home
make models   # probe VRAM → ranked shortlist with real sizes → download → bench → register
make bench    # measure background+glow GPU cost against the 3% cap (§5.6); prints pass/fail
make types    # regenerate schema.gen.ts (make check verifies it, this writes it)
```

`make dev`, `make check`, `make models` are the three the brief requires; `bench` and `types` exist
because §5.6 and rule 0.5 need a command you can run, not a paragraph you can read.

### 8.4 Section 5 acceptance criteria (it's a requirement, so it gets tested like one)

| Criterion | How it's verified |
|---|---|
| Background + glow < 3% GPU while generating | `make bench` samples `nvidia-smi dmon` with generation running, shader on then off; the delta is the number, and it's printed in the README. |
| 30fps cap while streaming, 60 idle, demand after 20s | Frame counter asserted in `perf.ts` and shown in a dev overlay. |
| Half-res FBO | Render target size assertion in the dev overlay. |
| Energy transitions are springs, never steps | `energy.ts` exposes the spring; a step change is a lint-level mistake, and the dev overlay plots `uEnergy` so you can see it settle. |
| `prefers-reduced-motion` | Static gradient, instant transitions, orb → pulse dot; checked with the media query forced on. |
| Contrast ≥ 4.5:1 | `scripts/contrast_check.py` in `make check`. |
| VRAM cost of the shader | Measured at startup and shown in the HUD next to the model's usage — the two roommates, side by side. |

---

## 9. Security posture (brief §7), as concrete invariants

1. **Bind guard.** `settings.py` refuses to start if `host` is non-loopback and no auth is
   configured. Not a warning — a startup failure with the reason printed.
2. **Inference ports stay loopback.** `make dev` starts llama.cpp with `--host 127.0.0.1`; the
   registry refuses to register a local provider URL that isn't loopback unless you set an explicit
   override flag.
3. **Tools are gated by default (M6).** Shell, file write, and network POST require per-call
   approval until you allowlist them per project; grants live in `tool_grants` and are visible and
   revocable in the UI.
4. **Audit log stores hashes and paths, never contents or secrets.** Enforced at the writer, so
   there's one place to review.
5. **Retrieved text is data.** Wrapped with provenance in the assembler; tool dispatch only ever
   reads the model's output channel. A document that tries to give instructions gets flagged and
   shown to you.
6. **No telemetry, verified by `make check`,** not by assumption.

## 10. What I need from you

1. **Approve or amend §6 (dependencies).** That list is the contract for the rest of the project.
2. **Confirm the placement in §0** — `sovereign/` inside this iOS repo, or move it to its own repo
   before M1.
3. **One number would sharpen §1:** is the card 8GB or 12GB? Both work, but 8GB means 16K context by
   default and Performance mode on by default, while 12GB means 32K and the full shader. I'll build
   the runtime detection either way — this only changes which defaults ship.

Nothing else is blocking. On approval I start M1 and stop at the first green checkpoint.
